# Public registration contract — 2026-09-05.1

## Investigation baseline

Inspected fetched `origin/main` in all three repositories:

| Repository                     | Baseline                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| acm-psu-website                | `4748062622a04b747639c1c52f634c6e79cff6e0` |
| acm-programming-jam-2026       | `d415766`                                  |
| ACM-CTF-3.0. (trailing period) | `024cb70`                                  |

Both config files used the endpoint below. Jam's config installed a capture
handler using iframe/postMessage, shared source tag and 20-second timeout,
while its inline form still contained a no-cors false-success handler. CTF
used iframe/postMessage, the shared tag, and a 20-second timeout. Both waited
for message `OK` on the effective iframe path. The main repo's active server
used Jam source `jam26`, omitted ALLOWALL and the top-window relay, and could
fall back to an active workbook. A separate unused handler draft conflicted
with those choices. Setup/retirement docs incorrectly said there were no public
Apps Script callers.

A read-only live GET of the existing `/exec`, following redirects, returned:

```json
{
  "status": "retired",
  "message": "This Apps Script only prepares the ACM PSU Club Records workbook."
}
```

This proves the live deployment differed from current repository source. The
provided POST screenshots show Google redirect-document 403 failures; the exact
Google-side access cause cannot be established from that status alone. A 302
redirect is not itself a failure, and ALLOWALL is not a claim to fix every 403.
The corrected version and anonymous web-app access must both be deployed and
verified in a browser.

## Endpoint and transport

Unchanged URL in both config files:

`https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwaTHKGlYWYXKk8Jd3b_9LXRksiTaZiw-jNwIKgfj7UzkqnxY9yFfQrGe4BhLnKMOq5/exec`

Normal `POST`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, targeted to a fresh hidden
iframe. No fetch/no-cors registration path. One form submit listener per page.
The transport creates an unpredictable 32-character lowercase hexadecimal
`requestId`, includes it with the fields below, and waits **30 seconds**. No
iframe load or HTTP status counts as successful registration.

### Jam

`event=jam26`, `fullName`, `universityId`, `universityEmail`, `phoneNumber`,
`major`, `teamName`, `teamMembers`, `website`, `requestId`.

`teamMembers` is a comma-separated list of up to ten valid email addresses, or
blank for a solo submission. `website` is the honeypot and must be blank.

Exact `jam26` columns, one row per team submission:

```text
Timestamp | Full Name | University ID | University Email | Phone Number | Major | Team Name | Team Members
```

### CTF

`event=ctf30`, `teamName`, `experience`, `captainName`, `captainId`,
`captainEmail`, `captainPhone`, `captainMajor`, `member2Name`, `member2Id`,
`member2Email`, `member2Major`, `member3Name`, `member3Id`, `member3Email`,
`member3Major`, `website`, `requestId`.

Experience is exactly `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced`. All four
Member 3 fields must be present together or blank together. Only the captain
has a phone. Rules agreement is enforced by the page; it is not a stored sheet
column. No localStorage registration path is used.

Exact `ctf30` columns, one row per team:

```text
Timestamp | Team Name | Captain Name | Captain University ID | Captain University Email | Captain Phone Number | Captain Major | Member 2 Name | Member 2 University ID | Member 2 University Email | Member 2 Major | Member 3 Name | Member 3 University ID | Member 3 University Email | Member 3 Major | Experience Level
```

## Response

HtmlService with `XFrameOptionsMode.ALLOWALL`; the script calls
`parent.postMessage(payload,"*")` and, when different, `top.postMessage`.
No participant data is returned. Example acknowledgement:

```json
{
  "source": "acm-event-registration",
  "event": "jam26",
  "requestId": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "message": "OK",
  "version": "2026-09-05.1"
}
```

The frontend requires the Google origin, exact source, matching event, matching
requestId, and a string message. Only exact `OK` displays saved success. Server
errors are displayed with the optional `Error:` prefix removed. Wrong/stale
messages are ignored. Legacy callers may omit requestId server-side, but both
updated websites require their own echoed ID and cannot work with an older
backend. Timeout means unconfirmed, not necessarily unwritten.

GET returns only status/message/version, never workbook data:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "ACM PSU event registration endpoint is live.",
  "version": "2026-09-05.1"
}
```

## Platform mirror

After the worksheet row is appended and flushed — and only then — the script
POSTs the same row to the ACM PSU platform's `event-registration-intake` Edge
Function as JSON:

```json
{
  "event": "jam26",
  "requestId": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "fields": { "Timestamp": "2026-09-05T15:44:00.000Z", "Full Name": "…" }
}
```

`fields` is keyed by the exact worksheet headings above, and authorization is
the `x-registration-token` header carrying the shared secret. The endpoint is
idempotent: a registration is identified by a hash of its answers with the
timestamp excluded, so re-posting it, and a later import of the same worksheet
row, both write nothing.

This mirror is not part of the front-end contract. It is configured by Script
Properties (`PLATFORM_INTAKE_URL`, `PLATFORM_INTAKE_TOKEN`), skipped when they
are absent, wrapped so that no failure reaches the reply, and its response is
never read. The acknowledgement a participant sees is still produced solely by
the worksheet append, and `OK` continues to mean the worksheet row was written.

## Live acceptance checklist (not yet completed)

1. Jam: `ZZ Test Jam Delete Me`, ID `999000001`, email
   `999000001@psu.edu.sa`, phone `0500000000`, major `Software Engineering`,
   team `ZZ_TEST_DELETE_ME`, teammate `jam.test.member@psu.edu.sa`.
   Require server OK, exactly one row in jam26, teammate in H, then success UI.
2. Repeat Jam participant: require `this participant is already registered`,
   no added row and no success UI. If a previous failed-ack attempt already
   wrote this test identity, inspect that row before attempting a new test.
3. CTF: team `ZZ_TEST_TEAM_DELETE_ME`; captain `ZZ Test Captain`, ID
   `999000002`, email `999000002@psu.edu.sa`, phone `0500000000`, major
   `Computer Science`; member 2 `ZZ Test Member Two`, ID `999000003`, email
   `999000003@psu.edu.sa`, major `Computer Science`. Leave member 3 blank,
   choose Beginner and check rules. Require OK, exactly one row, L–O blank,
   P equal to Beginner, then REGISTRATION SAVED.
4. Fill only Member 3 Name: require the all-or-none error and no row. The
   browser blocks this before transport; a direct server test must also reject.
5. Verify anonymously in Chrome that the Google response executes within the
   iframe and the correct version replies. Local mocks cannot prove this.
