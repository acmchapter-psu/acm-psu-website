# ACM PSU workbook and public event registration

Supabase is canonical for platform records. `club-records-sheet-sync` refreshes
only its closed canonical allowlist. `jam26` and `ctf30` are separate append-only
public event records, never snapshot targets.

## Canonical Apps Script source

Install **both** `Code.gs` (workbook preparation and exact schemas) and
`EventRegistration.gs` (the only `doPost` and `doGet`) in the workbook's bound
Apps Script project. Remove older registration handler drafts from that project;
there must be one definition of each entrypoint. `PositionsSeed.gs` is retained reference
data, not part of the event integration. Do not paste the retired Jam
repository's `apps-script.gs` as a backend.

Web app writes use `SpreadsheetApp.openById` with the official club workbook ID
`1wXP3WvqcjnDEOe_sDSGXR-Z6HKvjnufarA4r-CovVEU`. Setup uses the bound workbook.

## Google deployment steps

1. Open **ACM PSU — Club Records → Extensions → Apps Script**.
2. Replace `Code.gs` and `EventRegistration.gs` with these two repository files.
   Remove conflicting old `doGet`/`doPost` definitions; save.
3. Run `setupClubRecordsWorkbook()` and authorize it as the workbook owner.
4. Confirm:
   - `Event jam26 — header row matches, left untouched.`
   - `Event ctf30 — header row matches, left untouched.`
     Newly empty tabs are seeded. If either reports **HEADER MISMATCH**, stop:
     review the existing schema and preserve all registrations before correcting
     headers. Neither setup nor registration overwrites mismatching event data.

   Lines beginning `WARNING` are expected on a workbook whose sheets are Google
   Sheets **Tables**: a typed column rejects the cosmetic formatting with
   _"You can't set the number format of cells in a typed column."_ Setup treats
   every appearance step as best-effort, so it records the refusal and carries
   on to the next column — the run still finishes, still prints this report, and
   still writes no data. Setup never creates, removes or modifies a filter,
   because a basic filter and a Table cannot share a range.

5. **Deploy → New deployment → Web app → Execute as: Me → Who has access: Anyone
   → Deploy**. Saving editor code alone does not update an existing deployment.
6. Copy the resulting `/exec` URL. If it differs, update only:
   - `Shoug-Alomran/acm-programming-jam-2026/config.js`: `window.JAM_ENDPOINT`
   - `Shoug-Alomran/ACM-CTF-3.0./config.js`: `window.ACM_EVENT_REGISTRATION_ENDPOINT`
7. Open the URL signed out. Expect `status: "ok"`, the live endpoint message,
   and `version: "2026-09-05.1"`. `retired` means the wrong version is deployed.
8. Merge/deploy the event repository changes via their GitHub Pages workflows.
   Both frontends now require the new server's echoed request ID.
9. Submit the test cases in `REGISTRATION-CONTRACT.md` through each public form.
   Confirm `OK` **and exactly one corresponding workbook row** for each event.
   Then verify duplicate rejection and partial-member rejection with no new rows.

Keep the URL shared by both sites. Do not archive the active event deployment
because an older migration document said all Apps Script callers were retired.
Older membership/position-signup endpoints can be retired after confirming they
are not the event endpoint.

## Copying registrations into the platform (optional)

An accepted registration can also be copied into the ACM PSU platform, where it
appears in **Admin → Records Backup** under _Events / Registrations_ and no
longer exists only in Google.

Configure it with two **Script Properties** (Project Settings → Script
Properties) — never in a `.gs` file, because this directory is public:

| Property                | Value                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `PLATFORM_INTAKE_URL`   | the `event-registration-intake` Edge Function URL |
| `PLATFORM_INTAKE_TOKEN` | its `EVENT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` secret             |

With either missing, the copy is skipped and registration behaves exactly as it
did before. The copy runs only after the worksheet row is appended and flushed,
its failures are swallowed, and its response is never inspected — so it cannot
change what a participant is told, and it cannot lose a registration. Rows the
copy never reached are recovered by the admin **IMPORT FROM REGISTRATION TABS**
button, which reads the `jam26`/`ctf30` tabs of this same workbook and adds only
what is missing.

The full platform-side procedure is `docs/SETUP.md` step 5b.

## Adding a new event's registration

The platform provisions the worksheet itself: an admin enables registration on
an event, picks a template, and the tab is created with the right columns (see
`docs/SETUP.md` step 5c). Nothing in this directory has to be edited for the
worksheet to exist, for the records backup to show it, or for the import to
read it.

What still has to be added here is the **intake config** — the entry in
`REGISTRATION_EVENTS` in `EventRegistration.gs` that says which fields the
public form posts, which are required, and which must be unique. Copy the
closest existing entry, set `sheet` to the worksheet name chosen in the admin
UI, and redeploy the web app. Until then the public form has no endpoint that
will accept it, though everything on the platform side is already in place.

## Security and operational limits

The handler allows only `jam26` and `ctf30`; validates fields and exact headers;
checks duplicates under a script lock; escapes formula-like cells; and appends
before acknowledging `OK`. It never returns workbook rows or accepts a sheet
name, credential, or shared frontend secret. The response permits iframe framing
and relays to both parent and top for Google's nested sandbox.

CacheService throttling is best effort: Apps Script supplies no trustworthy
client IP and cache entries may expire early. There is an event burst limit and
hashed submitter throttle, not a claim of comprehensive bot prevention.
An acknowledgement can be lost after a successful append: timeout deliberately
says the result is unconfirmed. Check the workbook before retrying.

## Local checks

`npm run test:registration` runs the mocked Apps Script safety tests.
`node scripts/check-event-contract.mjs /path/to/jam /path/to/ctf` verifies the
cross-repository contract and parses all event-site scripts. These checks do not
prove deployment permissions, iframe execution, or a live workbook write.
