# Setup

Follow these in order. Steps 1–3 are required. Steps 4 and 5 are optional
features you can add later without touching anything else.

Anything you paste into `.env.local` stays on your machine — that file is
gitignored.

---

## Step 1 — Create the Supabase project

1. Go to <https://supabase.com> and sign in with GitHub.
2. Click **New project**.
3. Organisation: pick or create one. Use a club-owned account, not a personal
   one, so the next committee can be given access.
4. Name: `acm-psu-platform`
5. Database password: click **Generate a password** and save it in the club's
   password manager. You will rarely need it.
6. Region: choose the one closest to Riyadh (`Central EU` or `Asia Pacific`).
7. Click **Create new project** and wait about two minutes.
8. In the left sidebar go to **Project Settings → Data API**.
9. Copy **Project URL**.
10. Copy the **anon / public** key (the long one labelled `anon`, _not_
    `service_role`).
11. In **Project Settings → General**, copy the **Reference ID**.
12. In the repository, copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

    ```
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<the Project URL from step 9>
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<the anon key from step 10>
    SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=<the Reference ID from step 11>
    ```

13. Tell Claude when this is done.

> The anon key is meant to be public — it is compiled into the website. Every
> table is protected by row level security, so the key alone opens nothing.
> Never put the `service_role` key anywhere in this repository.

---

## Step 2 — Create the database

Run these three commands in the repository:

```sh
npm install
npx supabase login          # opens a browser, click Authorize
npx supabase link --project-ref <your Reference ID>
npx supabase db push        # creates every table, policy and bucket
```

`db push` runs everything in `supabase/migrations/` in order. It is safe to run
again; migrations already applied are skipped.

Then check it worked:

```sh
npx supabase db lint
```

---

## Step 3 — Make yourself the first admin

The system has no permanent owner built into it, so the first super admin is
granted once by hand.

1. Run `npm run build`, then `npm run serve`.
2. Open <http://localhost:8000/portal/signup.html> and create your account.
3. Check your email and click the confirmation link.
4. In the Supabase dashboard, open **SQL Editor → New query**.
5. Paste this, with your own email, and click **Run**:

   ```sql
   select public.bootstrap_super_admin('your.email@psu.edu.sa');
   ```

6. You should see `super_admin granted to …`.
7. Open <http://localhost:8000/admin/index.html>. You now have the admin console.

`bootstrap_super_admin` refuses to run a second time. From here on, admins are
granted from **Administration → Grant a role**.

### Auth email links

In the Supabase dashboard, **Authentication → URL Configuration**:

1. **Site URL:** `https://acmchapter-psu.github.io/acm-psu-website`
2. **Redirect URLs:** add both of these:
   - `https://acmchapter-psu.github.io/acm-psu-website/portal/auth-callback.html`
   - `http://localhost:8000/portal/auth-callback.html`
3. Click **Save**.

### Deploying

In the GitHub repository, **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables → New repository variable**, add:

| Name                       | Value            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | your Project URL |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | your anon key    |

Push to `main` and the site deploys with the portal connected.

## Step 4 — Cloudflare Workers AI (optional)

This powers the review assistant on the archive review page. Everything else
works without it. The assistant only suggests; it can never publish.

1. Go to <https://dash.cloudflare.com> and sign in.
2. On the right of the overview page, copy your **Account ID**.
3. In the left sidebar click **Manage Account → Account API Tokens**.
4. Click **Create Token**, then **Get started** next to _Create Custom Token_.
5. Name it `acm-psu-workers-ai`.
6. Under **Permissions** choose: `Account` → `Workers AI` → `Read`.
7. Click **Continue to summary**, then **Create Token**.
8. Copy the token — it is shown only once.
9. Back in the repository, run:

   ```sh
   npx supabase secrets set \
     CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<the Account ID from step 2> \
     CLOUDFLARE_AI_TOKEN=<the token from step 8> \
     CLOUDFLARE_AI_MODEL=@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct

   npx supabase functions deploy ai-review
   ```

10. In the admin console, go to **Administration → Settings** and turn on
    **Review assistant**.
11. Tell Claude when this is done.

---

## Step 5 — Google Sheets: the Club Records workbook (optional)

CSV and XLSX export already work and are enough to hand the university a
spreadsheet. This step adds a button that pushes straight into a private Google
Sheet.

1. Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com>.
2. Top bar → project dropdown → **New Project**. Name it `acm-psu-records`.
   Click **Create**, then select it.
3. In the search bar type `Google Sheets API`, open it, click **Enable**.
4. In the left sidebar: **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
5. Click **Create Credentials → Service account**.
6. Name: `acm-sheets-writer`. Click **Create and continue**, then **Done**.
7. Click the service account you just made, then the **Keys** tab.
8. **Add key → Create new key → JSON → Create**. A `.json` file downloads.
9. Open that file. You need two values from it:
   - `client_email` — looks like `acm-sheets-writer@…iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - `private_key` — a long block starting `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`
10. Go to <https://sheets.google.com> and create **one** new blank spreadsheet.
    Name it exactly `ACM PSU — Club Records`.

    One workbook holds every dataset as a separate worksheet — Members, Event
    Participation, Contributions and Inquiries. Each tab is created
    automatically the first time you export to it. Do not make a spreadsheet
    per dataset.

11. Click **Share**, paste the `client_email` from step 9, give it **Editor**,
    and untick "Notify people". Click **Share**.
12. Copy the spreadsheet ID out of its URL — the long string between
    `/d/` and `/edit`.
13. In the repository, run (keep the quotes exactly as shown):

    ```sh
    npx supabase secrets set \
      GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL='<client_email from step 9>' \
      GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID='<the ID from step 12>'

    npx supabase secrets set GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="$(python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open('/path/to/downloaded.json'))['private_key'])")"

    npx supabase functions deploy university-export
    ```

14. In the admin console: **Administration → Settings** → turn on
    **Google Sheets export**.
15. Tell Claude when this is done.

> Keep that workbook private. Nothing in the member portal or on the public
> website can reach it.
>
> **Converting a worksheet into a Google Sheets Table is safe but pointless
> here.** A Table's columns are typed and reject the formatting the sync
> applies, so the export writes its data, logs a warning, and leaves that tab
> plainer than the others. The records themselves are unaffected, and the sync
> neither creates nor removes filters, so nothing it does can collide with a
> Table you add by hand.
>
> **This is the club's live administrative workbook, and it stays one file.**
> Google applies permissions to a whole spreadsheet rather than tab by tab, and
> the Inquiries worksheet can contain information submitted by members of the
> public. When the university needs records, export a separate reporting copy
> containing only the relevant worksheets — the per-dataset CSV and XLSX
> downloads on the Club Records page are the simplest way to produce one.
> Do not share the live workbook itself.

---

## Step 5b — Public event registrations in the records backup (optional)

Public event signups (Programming Jam, CTF) are collected by the Apps Script in
`apps-script/`, which appends them to the `jam26` and `ctf30` tabs of the **same
`ACM PSU — Club Records` workbook** you set up in step 5:

```
1wXP3WvqcjnDEOe_sDSGXR-Z6HKvjnufarA4r-CovVEU
```

There is no separate registration file and nothing extra to share — the service
account already has Editor on this workbook from step 5, step 11. What keeps
those tabs safe is that the snapshot sync excludes them **by name**: it writes
only the ten canonical worksheets and has never written a cell of `jam26` or
`ctf30`. Those two tabs stay the intake surface and nothing here changes them.

This step gives the signups a second home in Supabase, so they appear in
**Admin → Records Backup** under _Events / Registrations_ and survive anything
that happens to the spreadsheet. Without it, registration still works exactly
as before — it simply stays Google-only.

1. Invent a long random shared secret (any 40+ random characters):

   ```sh
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. Give it to Supabase and deploy the function:

   ```sh
   npx supabase secrets set EVENT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN='<the secret from step 1>'

   npx supabase functions deploy event-registration-intake --no-verify-jwt
   ```

   The import reads `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID` from step 5, because that is
   the workbook the registration tabs are in. `EVENT_REGISTRATION_SPREADSHEET_ID`
   exists only to override it if those tabs are ever moved into a file of their
   own; leave it unset.

3. Give the same secret to the Apps Script. In the Apps Script editor:
   **Project Settings → Script Properties → Add script property**, twice:

   | Property                | Value                                                                      |
   | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `PLATFORM_INTAKE_URL`   | `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/event-registration-intake` |
   | `PLATFORM_INTAKE_TOKEN` | the secret from step 1                                                     |

   The secret is a credential and `apps-script/` is public in this repository,
   so it lives in Script Properties and never in a `.gs` file. With either
   property missing the copy is skipped silently and registration is unaffected.

4. Redeploy the Apps Script web app (see `apps-script/SETUP.md`).
5. Register once on the live event site and confirm the row appears both in the
   `jam26`/`ctf30` tab and under **Records Backup → Events → Registrations**.
6. Click **IMPORT FROM REGISTRATION TABS** on that page once, to bring in
   everything submitted before this was configured. It is safe to click again
   at any time — a registration already recorded is counted, not duplicated.

> The copy is deliberately one-directional and best-effort. The Apps Script
> writes its worksheet row first and only then tries this endpoint, so a
> Supabase outage can never turn a saved registration into an error the
> participant sees; the import in step 6 recovers anything the copy missed.

---

## Step 5c — Registration for a new event

Once step 5b is done, adding registration to a future event needs no migration,
no code and no hand-made worksheet.

In **Admin → Projects & Events** (or, for a faculty advisor, **Assigned
Activities**), open or create the event and use the **Public registration**
section:

1. Tick **Enable registration**.
2. Choose a **registration template** — Individual, Basic team, or Structured
   3-person team. The columns it will create are listed underneath.
3. Accept or edit the suggested **worksheet name** (for example
   `hackathon261`). Lowercase letters, digits, underscore and hyphen only.
4. Save.

The platform then records the form against that event and creates the worksheet
in the club records workbook with exactly the template's columns. The event
appears under **Records Backup → Events → Registrations**, and **IMPORT FROM
REGISTRATION TABS** picks it up automatically — nothing has a list of events in
it.

What it will not do, on purpose:

- overwrite a worksheet that already exists with different columns — it reports
  the difference and changes nothing;
- change the template or the worksheet name once the first registration has
  been recorded, because the columns describe rows that already exist;
- delete anything when registration is switched off. Closing a form leaves the
  worksheet and every recorded registration exactly as they are.

> **The public form itself is separate.** This provisions the platform's side —
> the record, the worksheet and the backup view. The page people register on,
> and the Apps Script `REGISTRATION_EVENTS` entry that accepts its submissions,
> are still added by hand for each event; see `apps-script/SETUP.md`. Until that
> entry exists, the worksheet is ready and the import works, but the public form
> has nowhere to post.

## Step 6 — Emailing inquiry responses (not yet implemented)

**This does not exist yet, and the interface says so rather than pretending
otherwise.** Today the workflow is:

1. An admin opens the inquiry and writes the response. Saving records it
   against the inquiry and marks it Answered.
2. They click **Open in mail client**, which opens their own email app with the
   sender, subject, reference and response pre-filled.
3. They send it, then click **Mark as sent**, which is what sets
   `response_delivered`.

Until step 2 is automated, the admin page shows a warning counting responses
that were written but never marked as sent, so nothing silently goes unanswered.

### What would be needed to send automatically

1. Choose a transactional email provider — **Resend** is the simplest for this
   (generous free tier, one API call). SendGrid, Postmark or Amazon SES work
   equally well.
2. Verify the sending domain so mail from `acmchapter@psu.edu.sa` (or a club
   subdomain) is not treated as spam. **This needs DNS access and is the part
   that actually takes time** — SPF, DKIM and DMARC records at the domain
   registrar. Ask whoever administers `psu.edu.sa`; if that is not possible,
   send from a club-controlled subdomain instead.
3. Store the API key as an Edge Function secret:

   ```sh
   npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=... ACM_FROM_EMAIL='ACM PSU <acmchapter@psu.edu.sa>'
   ```

4. Add a `send-inquiry-response` Edge Function that re-checks the caller is
   staff, loads the inquiry, sends the mail, and sets `response_delivered` and
   `delivery_note`.
5. Point the **Mark as sent** button at that function instead of the mailto:
   link.

Tell me when the domain is verified and I will write the function. Nothing
else in the platform depends on this — inquiries are fully usable without it.

---

## Step 7 — Spam protection for the contact form (optional)

The public contact form is protected by a honeypot field, per-email rate limits
(3 per hour, 10 per day) and a global ceiling of 120 per hour, all enforced in
the database rather than the browser. That is enough for a student club.

If the form is ever targeted properly, add **Cloudflare Turnstile**:

1. Cloudflare dashboard → **Turnstile** → **Add site**.
2. Domain: `acm-psu.shoug-tech.com`. Widget mode: **Managed**.
3. Copy the **site key** and the **secret key**.
4. Tell me both are ready — the site key goes in the page, the secret is
   verified inside `submit_inquiry` via an Edge Function.

## Everyday commands

```sh
npm run build      # rebuild the portal after changing anything in platform/
npm run watch      # rebuild on save while developing
npm run typecheck  # check types without building
npm run serve      # http://localhost:8000
npm run db:push    # apply new migrations
npm run types:pull # regenerate database types from the live schema
```

The public website (`index.html`, `team.html`, …) needs no build at all. Edit
the HTML and refresh.
