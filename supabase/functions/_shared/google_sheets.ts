/**
 * Google Sheets export.
 *
 * ONE workbook, many worksheets. GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID identifies the
 * single private "ACM PSU — Club Records" file; each dataset becomes a tab
 * inside it, created on first use. There is no expectation of a separate
 * spreadsheet per dataset.
 *
 * Supabase stays the operational system. This writes snapshots out and never
 * reads back one of the worksheets it writes, so the workbook cannot become a
 * second, diverging source of truth. (readGoogleSheet below reads the event
 * registration tabs, which this module never writes — see its comment.)
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED TO FAIL. The data write is not: a snapshot that did not
 * land must be reported as a failure. Everything after it — header styling,
 * frozen row, column widths, row tints — is presentation and is best-effort,
 * because a canonical worksheet may have been turned into a Google Sheets
 * Table whose typed columns reject formatting. No filter is created, cleared
 * or modified at all; a basic filter cannot share a range with a Table.
 *
 * Authentication is a service account: a JWT signed with the account's private
 * key is exchanged for an access token. The key lives in an Edge Function
 * secret. Nothing here is reachable from a browser.
 *
 * Required secrets (see docs/SETUP.md step 5):
 *   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
 *   GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY               (the PEM; literal \n sequences are fine)
 *   GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID
