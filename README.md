# acm-psu-website

Official website of the ACM Club at Prince Sultan University — the public
digital archive, plus the member portal and admin console that keep it running.

**Live:** https://acmchapter-psu.github.io/acm-psu-website/

---

## What this is

Three things in one repository:

1. **The public website** — plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step.
   Open any `.html` file in a browser and it works.
2. **The member portal** (`/portal/`) — apply for membership, keep a profile,
   volunteer for events, submit work for verification, submit files to the
   archive, and make privacy or membership requests.
3. **The admin console** (`/admin/`) — applications, members, positions,
   projects, review queues, member requests, university exports, admin roles,
   and a full audit and decision history.

The portals are TypeScript compiled to static files, so the whole site still
deploys to GitHub Pages. Behind them is a Supabase Postgres database where all
the access rules actually live.

> **The rule the system is built on:** members control who they are, ACM
> verifies what they did, and the archive preserves both.

## Setup

New to this repository, or setting it up for a new committee? Start with
**[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)** — numbered steps, nothing assumed.

```sh
npm install
npm run build      # compile the portal
npm run serve      # http://localhost:8000
```

The public pages work without any of that. `npm run build` is only needed after
changing something in `platform/`.

## Security in one paragraph

Every consequential action is a database function that performs the change and
writes its audit entry in the same transaction, so an approval can never exist
without a record of who made it and why — see
[docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md). Authorization is enforced by the database, not
the interface. Every table has
row level security; `supabase/migrations/*_row_level_security.sql` is the
authoritative statement of who can do what, and it holds for anyone with a
browser console. The Supabase anon key compiled into the site is public by
design and grants nothing on its own. Privileged credentials — the service role
key, the Cloudflare token, Google's private key — exist only as Supabase Edge
Function secrets and never appear in this repository or in a bundle.

---

## Deployment

Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which type-checks
the portal, rebuilds its bundles, stages the repository (minus `platform/`,
`supabase/`, `docs/`, `design-template/` and CI files) and publishes to GitHub
Pages.

One-time setup in the GitHub repository settings:

1. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:** select
   **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables:** add
   `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

The public site is served at
`https://acmchapter-psu.github.io/acm-psu-website/`.

## Editing content

- **A team member:** they set their profile to Public in the portal and appear
  on `team.html` automatically. Hand-written `.member-card` blocks still work.
- **A project:** create it in **Admin → Projects & Events**, or copy a
  `.case-study-card` block in `projects.html` and set `data-category`.
- **An archive year:** copy a `.timeline-row` in `index.html`.
- **A translation:** add `"English source": "Arabic"` to `DICT` in
  `assets/js/i18n.js`.

Anything that would otherwise be hardcoded — the current chapter year, whether
applications are open, the club email, accepted PSU email domains — is edited
in **Admin → Administration → Settings**, not in the code.

---

## The old membership form

`apps-script/` holds the Google Apps Script that used to receive membership
applications when the site was static-only. Applications now go through the
portal, where they get an account, a status page and a member dashboard on
approval. The script is kept for reference and for `positions.html`, which
still uses it; it can be retired once event opportunities fully replace that
page.
