/**
 * Carrying the sign-up answers into the account.
 *
 * When someone creates an account with email confirmation on, there is no
 * session yet, so the browser cannot write to app_users or member_profiles —
 * row level security has nobody to authorise. The only channel that survives
 * the gap is the auth user's own metadata, which the sign-up call can set.
 *
 * So the extra questions on the sign-up form are stashed in user_metadata and
 * applied here, once, the first time the person actually has a session.
 *
 * Three properties matter:
 *
 *   - It only ever FILLS BLANKS. If the field already has a value — because
 *     the person has since edited their profile, or an admin set it — the
 *     metadata is ignored. Sign-up answers are the oldest information there
 *     is and must never overwrite something newer.
 *
 *   - It touches only member-owned columns. Student ID, email and account
 *     state are administrative facts guarded by a database trigger, and the
 *     membership application is where a student ID is collected and checked.
 *
 *   - It never throws. A profile that could not be pre-filled is a small
 *     inconvenience; a sign-in that fails because of one is not.
