/**
 * PSU term codes.
 *
 * The university numbers each term <YY><T>: the last two digits of the
 * Gregorian year the academic year *starts* in, followed by the term within
 * that year. So 261 is the Fall that begins in 2026, 262 the Spring that
 * follows it in 2027, and 263 that same academic year's summer.
 *
 * The boundaries below come from PSU's maintained academic calendar. They are
 * intentionally explicit: for example Term 262 begins on 13 December 2026,
 * so broad month-based guesses would incorrectly call it Term 261.
 *
 * There is no semester column anywhere in the database; the club is organised
 * by chapter year. Terms are therefore derived from each record's own date,
 * which is why this lives in one place rather than being re-guessed per page.
