/**
 * Member requests.
 *
 * Three things people often conflate are kept separate here, and the page says
 * so plainly, because the difference matters to the person making the request:
 *
 *   Hide my public profile  — you stay a member; the website stops listing you.
 *   Withdraw from ACM       — you stop being an active member; your record stays.
 *   Delete my account       — you lose sign-in; official records still stand.
 *
 * No request destroys verified contributions or position history. Those are
 * the club's record of work that genuinely happened.
