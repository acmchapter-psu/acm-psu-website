/**
 * Create an account.
 *
 * Signing up is not the same as joining ACM: it creates a login, and the
 * membership application is a separate, deliberate step afterwards. Keeping
 * them apart means someone can have an account while their application is
 * still being read, and an alumnus keeps an account after leaving.
 *
 * The form asks for more than a login needs, in the same voice as the
 * membership application, for two reasons: four anonymous boxes are a worse
 * first impression of the chapter than the rest of the site gives, and every
 * answer here is one the application form no longer has to ask for — it
 * arrives pre-filled instead.
 *
 * Credentials and the person's university role are required. The student-only
 * details below them are optional, which is why none of them blocks the button.
 *
 * The extra answers travel in the auth user's metadata rather than being
 * written directly: with email confirmation on there is no session at this
 * point, so there is nobody for row level security to authorise. They are
 * applied on first sign-in — see lib/signup-profile.ts.
 *
 * A student ID is deliberately NOT asked for here. It is an administrative
 * identifier, guarded in the database, and the membership application is where
 * it is collected and checked against the person.
